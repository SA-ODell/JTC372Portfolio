  <h1>A few of my projects</h1>
  <p>Here are a couple of the projects I worked on during my first year as a student coder.</p>

  <h2>How Many Beers?<h2>
  <p><a href="https://steveodell.github.io/HowManyBeers/"><img class="projecticon" src="../assets/BeerFinder.jpg" alt"picture of two beers"></a>This web app makes calls to the Nutritionix API in order to tally your daily calories, then calculates how many beers you can have at the end of the day without going over your daily calorie budget.</p>
  <p>Web app is <a href="https://steveodell.github.io/HowManyBeers/">here</a> and GitHub Repo is <a href="https://github.com/SteveODell/HowManyBeers/blob/master/README.md">here.</a></p>

  <h2>Running Social<h2>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/RunningSocial/RunningSocial/blob/master/Readme.md"><img class="projecticon" src="../assets/RunningSocialApp.jpg" alt"splash page of our Running Social app"></a>A group project at Galvanize, the Running Social app allows users to set up runs, hike, or bike rides, and then post them for other users to see, in order to help facilitate group runs for people of similar abilities. The app was not released because of potential privacy concerns, but you can see how it would work by watching the quicktime video at the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/RunningSocial/RunningSocial/blob/master/Readme.md">here.</a></p>

  <h2>Foster Parent Survival Guide<h2>
  <p><img class="projecticon" src="../assets/fpsg-logo-app.png" alt"logo for the Foster Parent Survival Guide mobile app">A work still in progress, the FPSG is a one-stop-shop for Foster Parents, who are typically inundated with reporting requirements that are time consuming and hard to track. These come from county, state, and federal requirements, and are often redundant or conflicting. Note-taking apps like Evernote help, but they don't go far enough and do not offer enough customization. And because we are dealing with children, there are privacy and security concerns with storing data.</p>

  <p>Some examples of reporting and tracking requirements include doctor's appointments, administration of Rx meds, signing for supplemental WIC checks, enrolling in new schools, parent-teacher conferences and Individual Education Plan reviews. But there are other special one-off reporting requirements as well. For instance, if a child in foster care falls down at the play ground and gets a bruise, the injury must be reported so that this injury isn't conflated with any suspected child abuse events.</p>

  <p>As a result, most foster parents end up with a three-ring binder for each child, filled with forms that the foster parent must fill out but also copies of documents such as Rx receipts. These binders are a lot of work. They cannot be carried around as the foster parent goes about his or her daily business.  And then, for short term foster care situations, you have a filing or disposal problem when the child moves on.</p>

  <p>For all of these reasons, a mobile app is the perfect solution. And any note taker such as Evernote would get you halfway there. But there are missing ingredients from services now available, such as the ability to produce custom forms (eg, Rx log or recording household fire drills) and to share documents without paying for premium subscriptions.</p>
